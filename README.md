# Chem KEGG Py-Project
Repo for the research methods class. The goal is to modernize, clean and adapt a former student's thesis project.

## Project Journal
### 7/28 
Started looking through the code and thesis then created a GitHub for the project.  
Made changes so that the code will run in a python 3 environment.  
Created JSON files for the differing lists & dictionaries.  
Added a code section that checks if the user has bioservices installed.
